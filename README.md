# COEN177-Operating_Systems
This repository contains my COEN 177 – Operating Systems programming projects, implemented in C at Santa Clara University. The goal of these assignments is to practice core OS concepts, including process creation, interprocess communication, multithreading, synchronization (mutexes, semaphores), CPU scheduling, memory management, and file system interfaces. The repository includes source files for the implementations as well as any helper modules, header files, and supporting documentation. This project is shared for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. If you are currently enrolled in COEN 177, please do not copy this work or submit it as your own. Follow SCU’s academic integrity policies.
