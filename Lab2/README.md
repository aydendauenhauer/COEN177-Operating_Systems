This repository contains my Lab 2 project for COEN 177, where I wrote and tested C programs compiled with gcc outside the IDE to create multiple child processes using fork, pass delay values via command-line arguments, and observe how different parameters affect execution order, timing of parent/child output, and issues such as segmentation faults when required arguments are missing.
