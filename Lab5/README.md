This repository contains my Lab 5 project for COEN 177, where I implemented thread synchronization using POSIX semaphores and mutexes to enforce ordered access to a critical section and then built producer–consumer style programs based on classic pseudocode. The exercises demonstrate how different synchronization primitives affect thread behavior, printing order, and shared counter updates in multithreaded C programs.
