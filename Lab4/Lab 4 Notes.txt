Part 1:
Code is able to compile and execute. The program creates 20 threads (0-19), which each print "Hello from thread ___ with thread ID ___" as well as "Thread ___ returned" with the ___ being replaced with their values.
Here is an example of an output:
Hello from thread 6126448640 with thread ID 1 
Hello from thread 6127022080 with thread ID 7 
Hello from thread 6127595520 with thread ID 8 
Hello from thread 6128168960 with thread ID 9 
Thread 0 returned 
Thread 1 returned 
Thread 2 returned 
Thread 3 returned 
Hello from thread 6128742400 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6130462720 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6129315840 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6131609600 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6132756480 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6132183040 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6133329920 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6129889280 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6131036160 with thread ID 4

Main thread done.

Part 2:
Code is able to compile and execute. The program creates 20 threads, which each print "Hello from thread ___ with thread ID ___". I sometimes encountered times where the program would print 16 threads or 0 threads. 
Here is an example of an output:
Hello from thread 6101364736 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6104231936 with thread ID 7 
Hello from thread 6103658496 with thread ID 7 
Hello from thread 6104805376 with thread ID 8 
Hello from thread 6102511616 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6103085056 with thread ID 5 
Hello from thread 6101938176 with thread ID 6 
Hello from thread 6105378816 with thread ID 9 
Hello from thread 6105952256 with thread ID 10 
Hello from thread 6106525696 with thread ID 11 
Hello from thread 6100791296 with thread ID 4 
Hello from thread 6107099136 with thread ID 12 
Hello from thread 6107672576 with thread ID 13 
Hello from thread 6108246016 with thread ID 14 
Hello from thread 6108819456 with thread ID 15 
Hello from thread 6109966336 with thread ID 17 
Hello from thread 6109392896 with thread ID 16 
Hello from thread 6110539776 with thread ID 18 
Main thread done.
Hello from thread 6111686656 with thread ID 20

* It is important to note that the values for both part 1 and 2 change for every execute.

Part 3:
I was able to create the program by using the given code to randomly fill the matrices and multiply the rows. I simply had to create threads for each row, then use a nested for loop to print the C matrix.
