This repository contains my Lab 7 project for COEN 177, where I explored the MINIX scheduler by modifying the pick_proc() function in proc.c to randomly skip a ready queue about 10% of the time, effectively biasing the priority scheduling to occasionally choose a lower-priority queue instead. After rebuilding the system with make world and rebooting, I observed the impact of this change on system behavior and boot time.
