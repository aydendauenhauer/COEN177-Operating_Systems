//Description: To simulate three basic page replacement algorithms and evaluate the comparative performance of these algorithms with different cache sizes

FIFO:
Iterates through the cache array to check if the page is already present.
If found, it sets foundInCache = true and breaks out of the loop.
If the page is not found in the cache, a page fault occurs:
The page number is printed.
It is stored in the cache at placeInArray (the position where the oldest page was stored).
totalFaults is incremented to count the number of page faults.
placeInArray is updated using (placeInArray + 1) % cacheSize to move to the next position in a circular buffer.

LRU:
Tracks last access time of each page using lastUsed.
If a page is already in cache, updates its lastUsed timestamp.
If the page is not in cache, uses an empty slot if available.
Otherwise, finds and replaces the least recently used page.

Second Chance:
Gives pages a "second chance" before replacement. It tracks whether a page was recently used with a reference bit (ref).
If a page is found in the cache, its ref is set to 1.
If not, the algorithm looks for a page to replace by checking the ref of the current pointer position.
If ref == 1, it resets ref to 0 and moves forward until it finds a page with ref == 0, which is then replaced.
