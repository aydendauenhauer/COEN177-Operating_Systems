This repository contains my Lab 9 project for COEN 177, where I implemented and ran C programs to evaluate file system performance for sequential disk I/O under different buffer sizes, file sizes, and thread counts. The lab measures real/user/sys time for reading and writing several binary files, compares single-threaded vs multithreaded runs, and analyzes how buffer size and concurrency affect page faults, system overhead, and overall throughput.
