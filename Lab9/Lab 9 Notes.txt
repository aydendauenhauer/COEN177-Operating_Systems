//Title: Lab9 – File Performance Measurement
//Description: To evaluate file system performance in the face of sequential I/O requests, mainly disk reads and writes and evaluate the impact of multiple competing threads attempting to read/write simultaneously

Step 2:
Baseline performance -- file1.bin and file4.bin are slower; sys time is low.

Step 3:
Buffer size impact -- Larger buffers drastically improve performance, but file4.bin remains slow.

Step 4:
File-specific performance -- Buffering helps most files, but large ones still suffer from system overhead.

Step 5:
Multi-threading impact -- Threading improves performance up to a point, but high thread counts degrade performance due to system overhead.

Notes:
Small buffers result in higher overhead due to frequent system calls.
Large buffers consistently offer the best performance.
File 4 has longer execution times, due to its large size.
Smaller files quickly stabilize in execution time.
Works best with moderate thread counts (2–8).
High thread counts (32, 64) can introduce excessive system overhead, leading to worse performance.
Larger buffers mitigate the negative effects of multi-threading.
