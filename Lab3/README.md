This repository contains my Lab 3 project for COEN 177, where I experimented with Unix pipes, process control, and threads by chaining commands like ls through more, passing command-line arguments through a pipe, redirecting ls and cat /etc/passwd | grep root output via pipes, implementing a simple producer–consumer interaction, and creating multithreaded programs using pthread_create and pthread_join.
