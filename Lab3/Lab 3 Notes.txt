Part 1:
Code is able to compile and execute. The program executes the ls command however it uses the more command to separate the output from the ls command into new lines. In my case the output is:
Part1Executable
lab3_part1.c


Part 2:
Code is able to compile and execute. The program writes the command line into the pipe, reads it, then prints the command linen character by character. In my case the output is:
Writer on the upstream end of the pipe -> 1 arguments

Reader on the downstream end of the pipe
. / P a r t 2 E x e c u t a b l e


I tested the program again by adding another argument (./Part2Executable 500) to the command line and it output:
Writer on the upstream end of the pipe -> 2 arguments

Reader on the downstream end of the pipe
. / P a r t 2 E x e c u t a b l e 5 0 0


Part 3:
I changed part 2 such that the output from the 'ls' command is sent to the upstream and prints. The output is:
Writer on the upstream end of the pipe -> output from 'ls' command

Reader on the downstream end of the pipe
Part1Executable Part3Executable lab3_part2.c
Part2Executable lab3_part1.c lab3_part3.c


Part 4:
I changed part 1 such that the output from the 'cat /etc/passwd | grep root' is printed. The output is:
root:*:0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/sh
daemon:*:1:1:System Services:/var/root:/usr/bin/false
_cvmsroot:*:212:212:CVMS Root:/var/empty:/usr/bin/false


Part 5:
I was able to create a program such that the output is infinite appearances of:
consumer received: producer


Part 6:
The code compiles, but there is 1 warning. When running the executable, the output is:
